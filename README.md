# CodingQuiz

For this assignment I was tasked with creating a quiz that would gauge my level of understanding of the Javascript material we have previously learned in this bootcamp.

The instructions were that GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
